            Hey hey! It's been two long weeks and I haven't updated this blog in any way since! Whoops. But here I am
            now. Over the past two weeks I have been drilling JavaScript because React was just way too hard to grasp.
            Thankfully I found a good (free for one month) program that is thorough and I've been learning a lot! Anyway
            this post is dedicated to a Hot and Cold game that I want to implement in this blog! It will be a simple
            game, where the user inputs numerical values and tries to guess the "correct number". As the user guesses
            and their number gets closer to the "correct number" the computer will alert a cold, cool, warm, hot, super
            hot, and boiling notification! Building it the first time with Justin was confusing at first. It uses a
            while loop, which I didn't fully have a grasp on until now. I've got a few projects to finish with this
            JavaScript program but hopefully by the end of the day tomorrow I'll be jumping into a React program!

            OH! "I" (JP helped a LOT) built a cookie clicker program with React. That was kinda fun. But that means, now
            I just have the og cookie clicker app open on my browser and I'm wracking up cookies. I wonder if it's
            slowing down my Mac...

            Heyo. This post isn't going to be my hot-takes quite yet, I need to better establish those opinions. In the
            meantime, I "finished" freeCodeCamp's JavaScript program! I struggled a lot, to say the least. I'm still
            having trouble understanding the concepts and syntax's of things but I'm trying to take it one day at a
            time. JP thankfully takes time (a lot of time) out of his work day to help me learn, but it's still really
            hard for me
            not to get a bit frustrated and to wrap my head around everything. My next steps are learning React! I've
            heard it's pretty important and would be a really useful skill to have as a front-end web developer. I need
            to update this blog more often, and not just posting more frequently. I still have to make a few more blogs
            that follows what we eat, how we live, and my random thoughts! I'll work on that this weekend! I'm excited
            to make new blog pages; to design some different looks and get a feel for design!

            Well it certainly has been more than one day since my last post. But on the bright-side, I've "finished"
            Codecademy's JavaScript program. Now I'm onto freeCodeCamp's JavaScript, for both practice and to see if I
            learn anything new! I'm looking forward to implementing JavaScript into my blog! Hopefully I can make it
            easier for myself to make new posts. As of now, they're a little tricky moving all the "div's" and "p's"
            around, but I'm making it work. Kinda have to! Next up will be my hot-takes on both of these
            programs! :o

            I've been learning JavaScript slowly over the past week or so. On and off throughout the days. It's been
            really challenging! I'm processing it much slower than I would like to and the whole thing just becomes so
            frustrating. JP has been so sweet, taking time out of his workday to help me learn Functions and
            Arrays but my stubborn-ass can't properly accept or show gratitude towards his help. I'd imagine that's
            thoroughly frustrating for him too. I've gotta check my attitude for both of our sake's. I think the hardest
            time I'm having is with remembering syntax of the code, but also how it all works conceptually. My mind just
            doesn't let the links click in my brain, at least yet. JP does a really good job at explaining everything
            though, even when I've told him for the fourth time it still doesn't make sense. I am so lucky to have his
            help and guidance in this. I'm excited to learn more and hopefully become a really strong and creative
            front-end web dev!

            Hello! I think I've got the blog looking generally how I want, the trickiest part I've dealt with so far
            would be fitting the blog to a phone-screen size. It's definitely not perfect but it's good enough to send
            off to my family. Woo!
            <br />

            Until next time!

            Hey hey! So this isn't my first day of creating this blog, or this post even. I've been working on it for
            about 3-4 days and although you may have gone without ever knowing, I gotta write it in as this blog is
            about my development as a web developer!! It isn't perfect by any means and I still need to get the other
            blogs up and running. For now the blogs listed on the right are linked to random picutres!
            I've learned mostly html and css code. That's how I made this blog. I'm currently learning JavaScript which
            is taking me a bit longer but I'm hoping to get through the modules (of the online lesson plans I'm taking)
            by the end of the week. Hopefully I'll write in this blog daily, or every-other-day but who knows. As an
            unemployed "web developer", I've got little to no time, very busy days for me of course. Anyway, I'll leave
            it
            at that.
            <br />
            <br />
            For now, good bye!
