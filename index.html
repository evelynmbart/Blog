            Hello! I think I've got the blog looking generally how I want, the trickiest part I've dealt with so far
            would be fitting the blog to a phone-screen size. It's definitely not perfect but it's good enough to send
            off to my family. Woo!
            <br />
            <br />
            Until next time!

            Hey hey! So this isn't my first day of creating this blog, or this post even. I've been working on it for
            about 3-4 days and although you may have gone without ever knowing, I gotta write it in as this blog is
            about my development as a web developer!! It isn't perfect by any means and I still need to get the other
            blogs up and running. For now the blogs listed on the right are linked to random picutres!
            I've learned mostly html and css code. That's how I made this blog. I'm currently learning JavaScript which
            is taking me a bit longer but I'm hoping to get through the modules (of the online lesson plans I'm taking)
            by the end of the week. Hopefully I'll write in this blog daily, or every-other-day but who knows. As an
            unemployed web developer, I've got little to no time, very busy days for me of course. Anyway, I'll leave it
            at that.
            <br />
            <br />
            For now, good bye!
