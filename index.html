        <p>I have officially begun the application process. I'm specifically applying for any Frontend developer role,
            hoping for more of a Junior role but the markets not looking too great for those at the moment. I'm nervous
            but excited and hopefully at least ONE company will... TAKE A CHANCE ON MEEEE (abba reference)! Sort of
            feeling a lot of imposter syndrome, especially after telling people in tech what I'm doing. They don't seem
            optimistic. But I'm feeling confident and I just need to keep applying and learning and learning and
            applying. I want to start making silly web apps. Something that doesn't have a huge importance or purpose
            other than being a functional, pleasing-to-the-eye website. Have an idea for an OOPS btn app where everytime
            you click it some disaster happens on the screen. should be simple and easy to just crank out. But I'm a
            little under the weather and not in my usual home office space so we'll see how much I can get done. BUT now
            is still really the time to grind, I mean I haven't found a job yet.

            I'm on 'thanksgiving break', at my parents' spending it with them. Now's my time to GRIND. One last push to
            get the application process rolling! I've updated my resume and the portfolio is almost done. When I return
            to NY with Jp I'll just ask for some feedback and see where we are going from there! I'm excited but
            nervous. Jp's been doing interviews at his job and it's kind of making me realize what I need to show/do to
            impress the interviewer despite maybe being underqualified. I've gained some confidence from sitting in and
            from living in NY where everyone is selfish. My time has come!!!

            I learned a little about back-end! Just the simple version but nonetheless FUN! It was a nice break from
            front-end OH and I'm getting more used to Typescript. Forgot to mention I've been learning that too!
            Typescript 100% makes sense logically but I just need to get more used to the syntax and everything. I'm
            making more and more larger projects. Unfortunately though I'm still struggling with making the designs of
            these websites look more professional. I'm trying my best though and hopefully someone will *Take a chance
            on me* (in the next few months)

            It's been a minute! Hello! So we have furniture, we've been to a few concerts! Just saw Sarah Kinsley AAAH
            it was amazing. As for programming! Learning has been on more of a pause but I've been repeating a lot of
            projects and starting to come up with ideas on my own a bit better! I'm making more heafty projects now that
            are definitely worthy of being on the portfolio! A little nervous because money's running out and ya girl
            would LOVE a job at this very moment, but the portfolio just isn't ready. And for someone without
            professional experience, I NEED it looking good. Let's crank it out!!

            Goodness we're actually here. 10 hour drive went better than I expected! Wouldn't want to do it again any
            time soon haha. We've made quite a few trips to IKEA so far and starting to get some furniture into the
            house but thankfully we at least had a bed to start out with! Tux isn't adjusting too well and programming
            is sort of on a pause right now. Honestly the adjustment is big for all of us I think. We'll see how long we
            last...

            We actually found an apartment in Brooklyn. It was one of the most stress inducing events of my life but we
            got to party hard after we officially got approved for the apt. Kind of a good send off! Sad to leave NC but
            it was an opportunity we'd be stupid for not taking. As for programming, my levelyn-up folder is getting
            bigger! Slowly but surely. I've gotta grind more, any chance I can during this move. Let's hope for the

            Okay! So I'm really trying to push out as many projects, big or small, as I can (mostly small). I need to
            get more comfortable with the language and how to actually write code on my own - solving problems not just
            copy and pasting videos. But I've been able to get like 10 simple projects out. They're all in a folder
            called 'Levelyn-UP' LOL. I gotta keep it going but with the move coming up I might be coming to a bit of a
            stall...

            Hello! I've finished a few more mini projects: password generator and an alarm clock! They were fairly easy
            and fun to make but I'm not sure I could have come up with any of the code myself. But here's to learning
            and more exposure! I've decided to dedicate at least 30 minutes of programming a day (if I miss a day the
            following will be an additional 30 minutes of coding to make up for the lost time.) Justin and I got some
            new habit cards and instead of crossing off the habits we'll use stickers! FUN! I bought a million so I can
            choose a new one everyday. It's making habit making slightly more exciting. Hopefully more effective too.
            Today I didn't want to follow a video or anything so I reviewed the password generator code and added more
            comprehension comments that help me drill the ideas and formatting of the program! I also used the help of
            Teach with Tim's video to relearn the specific details I might have missed originally. I'm excited about
            this new journey, this new approach, and adding more to my blog! I need to add more to the html; get really
            good at the design which will be yet another honed skill under my developer belt!

            Just finished a few mini python projects. I made a farkle-type game, a madlibs generator, and a timed math
            game! My thoughts on the projects and on grasping the logic of python: I think for me it's getting better.
            I'm understanding the logic more, and the entire way of thinking is coming easier to me in terms of
            programming and technical thinking. Which is GREAT! It's making all of it much more fun. Justin has been
            right by my side the entire time thankfully! I can get support when needed and a tutor! Using both textbooks
            and videos to learn python or any other language is really useful. I think I mostly just need repitition
            now, obviously there are things I still don't know, but at least seeing them and getting the exposure
            through practice project videos online, can help me absorb as much as possible! So far when watching videos,
            the code is making sense. I still think it would take a minute before I could get the logic out, but again
            it's all about exposure and practice. I'm looking forward to more python! We'll see how much I get done in
            this next week though, I'm scheduled for 6 days which will be brutal. Wish me luck!

            Yikes it's been a while. Way too long, in fact. What have I been up to? Jp and I moved out of our
            apartment
            in MTL and are living with my parents back in VT! I haven't been grinding as much the past few weeks, if
            at
            all since all of the moving chaos. Chaos is exaggeratory but I've been kind of putting off getting back
            to
            React because I feel like I'm not as far into it as I'd like to be right now. But that's <b>exactly</b>
            why
            I need to get back on the grind! Starting tomorrow I will be grinding, I will be sorting through our

            Hey hey! It's been about two weeks... Despite the lack of updates, I have been progressing a lot with
            React
            and JavaScript! I have finished a few many-hour tutorials and am feeling stronger with React and have
            had
            less frustration fits. Today I'm going to start developing and desiging a project to work on to start a
            portfolio of web dev! I'm excited but also nervous because the more I learn the closer I am to actually
            getting a job in the Tech World, which is WAY off base for me. I've got little to no idea how it all
            works
            which is honestly terrifying. However, I'll adapt, I'll manage! I've got the best coder sitting to my
            right
            as we speak so I've always got help and support if needed. Anyway! that's my short update for today.

            Just finished my first React project. Disclaimer, I didn't know entirely what I was doing but I followed
            the
            video and it is technically done! Woohoo! I think I'll go back to re-re-learn some JavaScript essentials
            as
            they aren't entirely stuck in my brain yet. But so far learning React has gone well! I understand
            components, state, and props pretty fine; as much as any beginner would! The project I made was a simple
            Movie/Series Search Page! You can look up any movie or series and it should hopefully display them and
            display the year they were produced and if they are a series or movie! I basically only played around
            with
            the React side of this DOM, so don't hold the css and html against me! JP and I have decided it's
            probably
            best if I learn from videos and the internet for the time being because my behavior hasn't really gotten
            any
            better when we learn-teach with eachother. But this will be better for both of us! Better for the
            relationship for sure! I've gotta start grinding now as it's halfway through summer! Maybe soon I can
            apply
            for internships! I've gotta start spending some more time on React, JS, CSS, and HTML to keep
            progressing!

            Hey hey! It's been two long weeks and I haven't updated this blog in any way since! Whoops. But here I
            am
            now. Over the past two weeks I have been drilling JavaScript because React was just way too hard to
            grasp.
            Thankfully I found a good (free for one month) program that is thorough and I've been learning a lot!
            Anyway
            this post is dedicated to a Hot and Cold game that I want to implement in this blog! It will be a simple
            game, where the user inputs numerical values and tries to guess the "correct number". As the user
            guesses
            and their number gets closer to the "correct number" the computer will alert a cold, cool, warm, hot,
            super
            hot, and boiling notification! Building it the first time with Justin was confusing at first. It uses a
            while loop, which I didn't fully have a grasp on until now. I've got a few projects to finish with this
            JavaScript program but hopefully by the end of the day tomorrow I'll be jumping into a React program!

            Heyo. This post isn't going to be my hot-takes quite yet, I need to better establish those opinions. In
            the
            meantime, I "finished" freeCodeCamp's JavaScript program! I struggled a lot, to say the least. I'm still
            having trouble understanding the concepts and syntax's of things but I'm trying to take it one day at a
            time. JP thankfully takes time (a lot of time) out of his work day to help me learn, but it's still
            really
            hard for me
            not to get a bit frustrated and to wrap my head around everything. My next steps are learning React!
            I've
            heard it's pretty important and would be a really useful skill to have as a front-end web developer. I
            need
            to update this blog more often, and not just posting more frequently. I still have to make a few more
            blogs
            that follows what we eat, how we live, and my random thoughts! I'll work on that this weekend! I'm
            excited
            to make new blog pages; to design some different looks and get a feel for design!

            Well it certainly has been more than one day since my last post. But on the bright-side, I've "finished"
            Codecademy's JavaScript program. Now I'm onto freeCodeCamp's JavaScript, for both practice and to see if
            I
            learn anything new! I'm looking forward to implementing JavaScript into my blog! Hopefully I can make it
            easier for myself to make new posts. As of now, they're a little tricky moving all the "div's" and "p's"
            around, but I'm making it work. Kinda have to! Next up will be my hot-takes on both of these
            programs! :o

            I've been learning JavaScript slowly over the past week or so. On and off throughout the days. It's been
            really challenging! I'm processing it much slower than I would like to and the whole thing just becomes
            so
            frustrating. JP has been so sweet, taking time out of his workday to help me learn Functions and
            Arrays but my stubborn-ass can't properly accept or show gratitude towards his help. I'd imagine that's
            thoroughly frustrating for him too. I've gotta check my attitude for both of our sake's. I think the
            hardest
            time I'm having is with remembering syntax of the code, but also how it all works conceptually. My mind
            just
            doesn't let the links click in my brain, at least yet. JP does a really good job at explaining
            everything
            though, even when I've told him for the fourth time it still doesn't make sense. I am so lucky to have
            his
            help and guidance in this. I'm excited to learn more and hopefully become a really strong and creative
            front-end web dev!

            Hello! I think I've got the blog looking generally how I want, the trickiest part I've dealt with so far
            would be fitting the blog to a phone-screen size. It's definitely not perfect but it's good enough to
            send
            off to my family. Woo!
            <br />

            Hey hey! So this isn't my first day of creating this blog, or this post even. I've been working on it
            for
            about 3-4 days and although you may have gone without ever knowing, I gotta write it in as this blog is
            about my development as a web developer!! It isn't perfect by any means and I still need to get the
            other
            blogs up and running. For now the blogs listed on the right are linked to random picutres!
            I've learned mostly html and css code. That's how I made this blog. I'm currently learning JavaScript
            which
            is taking me a bit longer but I'm hoping to get through the modules (of the online lesson plans I'm
            taking)
            by the end of the week. Hopefully I'll write in this blog daily, or every-other-day but who knows. As an
            unemployed "web developer", I've got little to no time, very busy days for me of course. Anyway, I'll
            leave
            it
            at that.
            <br />
            <br />
            For now, good bye!
