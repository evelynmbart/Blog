            Everywhere you see “div” or “span” is a container tag. Where you see “class”, the HTML is kind of giving a
            name to that container so we can reference it elsewhere, like in CSS. Tags can have attributes of “id” or
            “class” for naming. The “id” is supposed to be unique per page, while a “class” can be shared.

            What we want to do is to focus on the div tags with a class of “one-member”, like on line 2. These then
            contain two more divs with classes “one-member-name” and “one-member-role”, like on lines 3 and 4. Since
            they are classes, we can create a CSS selector using a prefix of a period. (IDs are referenced with a prefix
            of the pound sign or hash, “#”.)
